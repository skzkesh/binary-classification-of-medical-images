# binary-classification-of-medical-images
Binary Classification is defined as the process of analyzing data and making decision between two elements. Binary classification model is used when we want to classify an item to one of two categories. This project focuses on applying binary classification to classifiy medical images into two categories, such as "organ absent" and "organ present". Previously, we successfully implemented this model to detect the present of thyroid and trachea in a sequence of ultrasound images with high accuracy.
